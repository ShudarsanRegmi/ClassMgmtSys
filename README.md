## Overview

The **Class Management System (CMS)** is a comprehensive web platform designed to streamline classroom operations and communication. It offers a multi-role environment for students, class representatives (CRs), class administrators (CAs), and system administrators to manage notices, attendance, materials, voting, and more.

Built with a powerful tech stack — **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, and **React.js** — the CMS ensures a dynamic and responsive user experience. It also supports offline capabilities through **Progressive Web App (PWA)** implementation and is built with scalability and modularity in mind.
